# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## Overview

This project implements an artificial intelligence (AI) agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI utilizes the Minimax algorithm, with the option of incorporating Alpha-Beta Pruning for improved efficiency. This project is designed to provide insights into game theory and fundamental search algorithms.

## Features

- Single-player mode against an unbeatable AI.
- Option to use Minimax algorithm with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- Interactive user interface for a seamless gaming experience.
- Display of current player's turn.
- Game board highlighting the winning combination.

## Minimax Algorithm

The AI player employs the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves and ensure an unbeatable performance in Tic-Tac-Toe. Minimax is a decision-making algorithm widely used in turn-based games, and its application in this project showcases the power of basic search algorithms.
